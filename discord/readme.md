# ServerQuery Bot
This is a key part of the overall ServerQuery project, you'll find everything related to the Discord bot itself below.

This directory contains everything related to the Discord bot. Here's a breakdown of its core functionalities:

* **Fetching Server Information**: The bot communicates directly with our backend server to retrieve up-to-date game embed settings and server information.
* **Game Server Querying**: Leveraging the power of GameDig, the bot efficiently queries game servers, extracting essential data for the embed creation process.
* **Graph Generation and Embed Customization**: The bot creates visually appealing graphs and customizes Discord embeds, presenting server statistics in an engaging and easily digestible format.
* **Channel Delivery**: After packaging the data into a neat and engaging format, the bot delivers the embeds to your chosen Discord channels, keeping your community in the loop about the game server status.

This folder contains all the bot's code, including the commands it supports (coming soon), the methods it uses to interact with the backend server, and the logic for creating and customizing the embeds. Feel free to explore and get to know more about the ServerQuery Bot!
