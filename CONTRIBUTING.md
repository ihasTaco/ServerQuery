# Contribution Guidelines
## Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to ServerQuery. It's people like you that make ServerQuery such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

**QA**: File bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open, or log files).
**Marketing**: Writing blog posts, tutorials, supporting new users, spreading the word about ServerQuery.
**Code**: Take a look at our open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github).

## Submitting code
Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also reference the issue that it resolves.

We use ESLint to ensure consistency in our JavaScript code. Please check your code with ESLint before submitting a pull request.

## Code review process
The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests into smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.

It is also helpful to explain why your pull request is a good idea. Providing context helps us decide when to merge your changes.

## Community
You can chat with the core team on our Discord server, [Royal Productions Bots](https://discord.gg/uJ96tnTP6G).

Remember, the goal is to create a welcoming, friendly, and collaborative community environment. All participants should behave in a manner that fosters a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
